A short description of the project:
	 Our game is a roguelike 2D platformer where the player moves to the right to encounter and kill enemies using a gun. 
It will have pixel/sprite graphics and will be programmed primarily in python. 
The defining feature of the game will be its dynamic AI that adjusts based on player habits. 
Each time the player kills a boss, the level advances and gets harder. Enemies will scale based on the level, not the player. 
When the player dies, he will increase in base stats so that the game will be easier until he reaches the final boss.
