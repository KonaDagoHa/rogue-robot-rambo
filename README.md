A short description of the project:
Our game is a roguelike 2D platformer where the player tries to kill the AI. 
This is a game where the player is the boss and the AI adapts to their patterns. 
It will have pixel/sprite graphics and will be programmed primarily in Python. 
The defining feature of this game entails that the AI learns your moves and 
eventually either you improve or let the AI get to you. 
Each time the AI improves, 
we give the player a chance by improving the playerâ€™s statistics.
